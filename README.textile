Sample "Processing":http://processing.org code to demonstrate how 3d authoring might work.

There are two concepts:

* @Sources@ - things that generate color values
* @Fixtures@ - things that sum color values for display

The basic idea is that each @Fixture@ sums the color inputs from every @Source@. A @Source@ is free to change its location and/or color every frame. Several examples are provided.

This code relies on the "PeasyCam":http://mrfeinberg.com/peasycam/ library.

Several shortcuts are defined:

* @s@ hides @Source@ objects
* @f@ hides @Fixture@ objects
* @r@ paints each @Source@ as a sphere with the range as the radius (which obscures any @Fixture@ it interacts with)
